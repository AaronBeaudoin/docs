## The Recipe

:::tip Requirements

### Create your Collections

1. Create your collections.
   - `title`
   - `images`
   - `videos (a URL field)`
   - `text_content`
2. Create an M2A relationship.

### Configure Permissions

You'll need to be sure each collection has access permissions. In our case, we want public read permissions for our m2a
content.

### Configure an M2A

- create m2a
- add collections
- other configurations
